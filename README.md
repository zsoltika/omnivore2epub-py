## omnivore2epub-py

So this simple sciprt relies on the following python packages:

- loguru
- omnivoreq
- mkepub

You also need to have an Omnivore API key (saved in an `API.key` file) 
in the same directory as the script itself, and a `cover.jpg` file too.

**NOTE** 
The generated EPUB file is not always accepted by Amazon's send to kindle 
service, because there might be some validation errors.
